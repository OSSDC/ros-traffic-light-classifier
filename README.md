# ROS Traffic Light Classifier 

The traffic light classifier node uses a combination of annotated map data and machine learning to perform traffic light classification with a high degree of accuracy. This technique is more robust to various lighting conditions and avoids misclassification when brake or tail lights are in the frame. 

This node relies on Autoware vector data and ROS messages. More information is located at [Autoware](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware)
